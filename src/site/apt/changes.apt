*----------------------------------+------------+
|| Change or bug || Change
*----------------------------------+------------+
| Listener block timeout error      | During read or take, the listener would always block for the length of the timeout,
|                                   | even when it has been previously notified and the timeout should decrease proportionally.
|                                   | Timeout now decreases correctly.
*----------------------------------+------------+
| Element written before listener kicked in | Listener is now activated before the search is performed, which
|                                   | fixes the problem of possible listener starvation.
*----------------------------------+------------+
| Notifying oldest listener first   | Increasing the possibility that listener starvation is avoided. Should also introduce
|                                   | a level of fairness to the listeners.
*----------------------------------+------------+
| No longer supporting jdk-1.5      | Jdk-1.5 is end of line. Use semispace-1.0.0 if you need 1.5 support.
